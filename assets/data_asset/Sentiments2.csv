Passive,Bkg: Comments,fr,"At the time of booking, I was not asked for my seating preferences. If I had this request I would have opted for a seat with more leg room and therefore more comfort. And when I called your call center, I was told that if I wanted to change seats it would pay while when I made my online registration I had the possibility to change seats at no extra cost. In addition. I was disappointed with the quality of the information provided by the call centre. I called the call centre a few days before my departure to confirm the list of documents to be provided at the airport. I was amazed at the operator's response. The operator was unable to give me the list of documents and suggested to me to call the French embassy. It is not at all professional and not at all consistent because at the airport unless I am mistaken. The registration is carried out by an Air Mauritius employee and not by the French Embassy. This employee clearly asked me for the list of documents required for my trip. It is your responsibility to provide your passengers and potential passengers with all the necessary information for their trip. ",À la réservation on ne ma pas demandé mes préférences de siège. si javais eu cette demande jaurais opté pour un siège avec plus de place pour les jambes et par conséquent plus de confort. Et quand jai appelé votre centre dappel on ma indiqué que si je voulais changer de siège ce serait payant alors que quand jai fait mon enregistrement en ligne javais la possibilité de changer de siège sans coût supplémentaire. Par ailleurs. jai été déçu sur la qualité des renseignements donnés par le centre dappel. Jai appelé le centre dappel quelques jours avant mon départ pour confirmer la liste de documents à fournir à laéroport. Jai été frappé de stupéfaction par la réponse de lopérateur. Lopérateur était incapable de me donner la liste des documents et ma suggéré dappeler lambassade de France. Ce nest pas du tout professionnel et pas du tout cohérent car à laéroport sauf erreur de ma part. lenregistrement est réalisé par un employé dAir Mauritius et non de lambassade de France. Cet employé ma clairement demandé la liste de documents nécessaires à mon voyage.

Detractor,F&B: Comments,en,The flight number MK 748 on 11 May was a rescheduled flight of my booking for 10/5. I phoned your customer care number at Port Louis once I was informed about the rescheduling to check whether we would be served breakfast and lunch since it was leaving Mauritius at 8.45 am and reaching Mumbai at 4.25 PM per schedule. This was done to confirm as if they were not providing two proper meals. I would have carried my own food in the flight as after landing at 4.25 pm in Mumbai one cannot have lunch. I got a confirmation from the attending person who kept me on hold. checked with higher officials and then reconfirmed that YES there would be continental breakfast and lunch during the flight. Based on that confirmation. I did not carry any food for the flight. Breakfast was given and when I inquired about lunch around 12.45 pm Mauritius time. the air hostess told me that there would be no lunch served and a sandwich will be given later. I was shocked as this was totally inconsistent with what was told to me by Air Mauritius staff earlier and I had not carried any food with me believing them. Given my acute acidity problems if my food is delayed. I told the air hostess to at least serve me the sandwich immediately as my stomach was already giving trouble and explained to her my conversation with Air Mauritius team on lunch and their confirmation. I also told her that Air Mauritius is not providing lunch for such flights. at least you should inform the guests in advance when they ask about it to avoid misleading so that the guests would have carried their own meal for a flight with that timings. I have a travelled a fair bit around the world and this is the first instance of an airline not providing lunch for a 8.45 am to 4.25 PM flight and you should be given an award for this. I also suggested to her that the air line could carry a few food stuff to be sold at a price like low cost carriers so that hungry passengers can buy the stuff when they feel hungry. It is absolutely unacceptable and you must send a personal apology to all guests on that flight. The air hostess just looked helpless and alongwith the sandwich which was ice cold gave we 3-4 packets of pretzel that you usually used give to first to guests after take off with the first drink.
